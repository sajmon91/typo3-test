You have to create a smart strategy to avoid editors from hiting the clear cache button all the time (more important in Boost-Mode):
I suggest this UserTsConfig:

   options.clearCache.pages = 0
   options.clearCache.all = 0

The user could use the clear cache in the page module or the admin have to use clearCacheCmd in a smart way.

Try to avoid this configuration:

   [backend.user.isLoggedIn]
       config.no_cache = 1
   [global]
